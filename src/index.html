        <h3>More about me</h3>
        <p>I have been coding since 2011, starting out with email building. When I started, i was instructed to use the Dreamweaver WYSIWYG but I quickly got to grips with the language that rendered what I was seeing; HTML. I learnt more and more and went on to make emails for big players like IKEA, British Gas and eBay. I now work for a digital agency where I build HTML5 banners and landing pages as well as emails. I'm currently making the jump from being a simple MA/email dev, to becoming a full on front-end developer and I'm loving every minute of it.</p>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing sax - I am currently in a ska-punk band called <a href="http://www.leadshothazard.com" target="_blank">Lead Shot Hazard</a>, and I am studying for Grade 6 jazz. I was also in a film orchestra but I had to give that up as i couldn't fit everything in. <br>
        I'm also a big gamer - I enjoy playing games such as ESO, Mass Effect and Resident Evil on my PS4. <br>
        As well as being all of the above, I'm a juggler too - my husband and I co-launched two circus skills societies and taught many people juggling, unicycle, and other circus skills. <br>
        I really, really hate food waste and I'm planning on putting together a food blog at some point this year. </p>
